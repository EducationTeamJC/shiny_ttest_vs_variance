# T-Test vs ANOVA: Understanding the Mathematical Relationship

## Overview

This interactive Shiny application demonstrates the mathematical equivalence between the t-test and ANOVA when comparing two groups. It provides a comprehensive visual and interactive exploration of how these two statistical tests are fundamentally the same for the two-group case.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Mathematical Equivalence**: Understand that t² = F for two-group comparisons
- **Conceptual Differences**: See how t-test focuses on group differences while ANOVA focuses on variance decomposition
- **Visual Understanding**: Explore the relationship through interactive plots and mathematical explanations
- **Practical Application**: Learn when and why you might choose one test over the other

## Features

### 1. Comparing t-test and ANOVA visualisation
### 2. t² = F Visualization
### 3. Comparing the Math
### 4. Comparing the Distributions

## Key Insights

### Mathematical Relationship
- **t² = F**: The t-statistic squared equals the F-statistic
- **Same p-values**: Both tests give identical p-values
- **Shared assumptions**: Both require normality, independence, and equal variances
- **Pooled variance**: Both use the same variance estimate

### Conceptual Differences
- **T-test perspective**: "How different are the group means?"
- **ANOVA perspective**: "How much variance is explained by group membership?"
- **Visual focus**: T-test emphasizes the difference arrow, ANOVA emphasizes variance components

### Practical Implications
- **Statistical power**: Both tests have identical power
- **Effect size**: Both are equally sensitive to the same effects
- **Interpretation**: Choose based on your research question and audience
- **Extension**: ANOVA generalizes to more than two groups
