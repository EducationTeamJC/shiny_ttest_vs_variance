# T-Test vs ANOVA: Understanding the Mathematical Relationship

## Overview

This interactive Shiny application demonstrates the mathematical equivalence between the t-test and ANOVA when comparing two groups. It provides a comprehensive visual and interactive exploration of how these two statistical tests are fundamentally the same for the two-group case.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Mathematical Equivalence**: Understand that t² = F for two-group comparisons
- **Conceptual Differences**: See how t-test focuses on group differences while ANOVA focuses on variance decomposition
- **Visual Understanding**: Explore the relationship through interactive plots and mathematical explanations
- **Practical Application**: Learn when and why you might choose one test over the other
